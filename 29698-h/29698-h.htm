<p><span class="dcap">Some joker</span> in the dear,
dead days now virtually beyond
recall won two-bit immortality
by declaring that,
"What this country needs is
a good five-cent cigar."</p>

<p>Which is, of course, Victorian
malarkey. What this
country <i>really</i> needs is a good
five-cent nickel. Or perhaps
a good cigar-shaped spaceship.
There's a fortune waiting
somewhere out in space
for the man who can go out
there and claim it. A fortune!
And if you think I'm just
talking through my hat, lend
an ear ...</p>

<p>Joyce started the whole
thing. Or maybe I did when
for the umpteenth time I suggested
she should marry me.
She smiled in a way that
showed she didn't disapprove
of my persistence, but loosed
a salvo of devastating negatives.</p>

<p>"No deal," she crisped decisively.
"Know why? No
dough!"</p>

<p>"But, sugar," I pleaded,
"two can live as cheaply as
one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is true," replied
Joyce, "only of guppies. Understand,
Don, I don't mind
changing my name from Carter
to Mallory. In fact, I'd
rather like to. But I have no
desire whatever to be known
to the neighbors as 'that poor
little Mrs. Mallory in last
year's coat.'</p>

<p>"I'll marry you," she continued
firmly, "when, as and
if you get a promotion."</p>

<p>Her answer was by no
stretch of the imagination a
reason for loud cheers, handsprings
and cartwheels. Because
I'm a Federal employee.
The United States Patent Office
is my beat. There's one
nice thing to be said about
working for the bewhiskered
old gentleman in the star-spangled
stovepipe and
striped britches: it's permanent.
Once you get your name
inscribed on the list of Civil
Service employees it takes an
act of Congress to blast it off
again. And of course I don't
have to remind you how long
it takes <i>that</i> body of vote-happy
windbags to act. Terrapins
in treacle are greased
lightning by comparison.</p>

<p>But advancement is painfully
slow in a department
where discharges are unheard
of and resignations rare.
When I started clerking for
this madhouse I was assistant
to the assistant Chief Clerk's
assistant. Now, ten years later,
by dint of mighty effort
and a cultivated facility for
avoiding Senatorial investigations,
I've succeeded in losing
only one of those redundant
adjectives.</p>

<p>Being my secretary, Joyce
certainly realized this. But
women have a remarkable
ability to separate business
and pleasure. So:</p>

<p>"A promotion," she insisted.
"Or at least a good, substantial
raise."</p>

<p>"In case you don't know it,"
I told her gloomily, "you are
displaying a lamentably vulgar
interest in one of life's
lesser values. Happiness, not
money, should be man's chief
goal."</p>

<p>"What good is happiness,"
demanded Joyce, "if you can't
buy money with it?"</p>

<p>"Why hoard lucre?" I
sniffed. "You can't take it
with you."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Joyce
flatly, "I'm not going. There's
no use arguing, Don. I've
made up my mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment our dreary
little impasse was ended by a
sudden tumult outside my office.
There was a squealing
shriek, the shuffle of footsteps,
the pounding of fists
upon my door. And over all
the shrill tones of an old, familiar
voice high-pitched in
triumph.</p>

<p>"Let me in! I've got to see
him instantaceously. This
time I've got it; I've absolutely
<i>got</i> it!"</p>

<p>Joyce and I gasped, then
broke simultaneously for the
door as it flew open to reveal
a tableau resembling the Laocoon
group <i>sans</i> snake and
party of the third part. Back
to the door and struggling valiantly
to defend it stood the
receptionist, Miss Thomas.
Held briefly but volubly at
bay was a red-thatched, buck-toothed
individual&mdash;and I <i>do</i>
mean individual!&mdash;with a face
like the map of Eire, who
stopped wrestling as he saw
us, and grinned delightedly.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Mallory," he
said. "Hi, Miss Joyce."</p>

<p>"Pat!" we both cried at
once. "Pat Pending!"</p>

<hr />

<p>Miss Thomas, a relative
newcomer to our bailiwick,
seemed baffled by the warmth
of our greeting. She entered
the office with our visitor,
and as Joyce and I pumphandled
him enthusiastically she
asked, "You&mdash;you <i>know</i> this
gentleman, Mr. Mallory?"</p>

<p>"I should say we do!" I
chortled. "Pat, you old naughty
word! Where on earth
have you been hiding lately?"</p>

<p>"Surely you've heard of the
great Patrick Pending, Miss
Thomas?" asked Joyce.</p>

<p>"Pending?" faltered Miss
Thomas. "I seem to have
heard the name. Or seen it
somewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pat beamed upon her companionably.
Stepping to my
desk, he up-ended the typewriter
and pointed to a legend
in tiny letters stamped
into the frame: <i>Reg. U.S. Pat.
Off.&mdash;Pat. Pending.</i></p>

<p>"Here, perhaps?" he suggested.
"I invented this. And
the airplane, and the automobile,
and&mdash;oh, ever so many
things. You'll find my name
inscribed on every one.</p>

<p>"I," he announced modestly,
"am Pat Pending&mdash;the greatest
inventulator of all time."</p>

<p>Miss Thomas stared at me
goggle-eyed.</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> he?" she demanded. "I
mean&mdash;<i>did</i> he?"</p>

<p>I nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>"Not only those, but a host
of other marvels. The bacular
clock, the transmatter, the
predictograph&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Thomas turned on Pat
a gaze of fawning admiration.
"How wonderful!" she
breathed.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, really," said
Pat, wriggling.</p>

<p>"But it is! Most of the
things brought here are so
absurd. Automatic hat-tippers,
self-defrosting galoshes,
punching bags that defend
themselves&mdash;" Disdainfully
she indicated the display collection
of screwball items we
call our Chamber of Horrors.
"It's simply marvelous to meet
a man who has invented
things really worth while."</p>

<p>Honestly, the look in her
eyes was sickening. But was
Pat nauseated? Not he! The
big goon was lapping it up
like a famished feline. His
simpering smirk stretched
from ear to there as he murmured,
"Now, Miss Thomas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sandra, Mr. Pending," she
sighed softly. "To you just
plain ... Sandy. Please?"</p>

<p>"Well, Sandy&mdash;" Pat
gulped.</p>

<p>I said disgustedly, "Look,
you two&mdash;break it up! Love
at first sight is wonderful in
books, but in a Federal office
I'm pretty sure it's unconstitutional,
and it <i>may</i> be subversive.
Would you mind
coming down to earth? Pat,
you barged in here squalling
about some new invention. Is
that correct?"</p>

<p>With an effort Pat
wrenched his gaze from his
new-found admirer and nodded
soberly.</p>

<p>"That's right, Mr. Mallory.
And a great one, too. One that
will revolutionate the world.
Will you give me an applicaceous
form, please? I want to
file it immediately."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, Pat. You
know the routine. What's the
nature of this remarkable discovery?"</p>

<p>"You may write it down,"
said Pat grandiloquently, "as
Pat Pending's lightening
rod."</p>

<p>I glanced at Joyce, and she
at me, then both of us at
Pending.</p>

<p>"But, Pat," I exclaimed,
"that's ridiculous! Ben Franklin
invented the lightning
rod two hundred years ago."</p>

<p>"I said <i>lightening</i>," retorted
my redheaded friend, "not
<i>lightning</i>. My invention
doesn't conduct electricity <i>to</i>
the ground, but <i>from</i> it." He
brandished a slim baton which
until then I had assumed to
be an ordinary walking-stick.
"With this," he claimed, "I
can make things weigh as
much or as little as I please!"</p>

<p>The eyes of Sandy Thomas
needed only jet propulsion to
become flying saucers.</p>

<p>"Isn't he wonderful, Mr.
Mallory?" she gasped.</p>

<p>But her enthusiasm wasn't
contagious. I glowered at
Pending coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Pat!" I
scoffed. "You can't really believe
that yourself. After all,
there <i>are</i> such things as basic
principles. Weight is not a
variable factor. And so far as
I know, Congress hasn't repealed
the Law of Gravity."</p>

<p>Pat sighed regretfully.</p>

<p>"You're always so hard to
convince, Mr. Mallory," he
complained. "But&mdash;oh, well!
Take this."</p>

<p>He handed me the baton. I
stared at it curiously. It
looked rather like a British
swagger stick: slim, dainty,
well balanced. But the ornamental
gadget at its top was
not commonplace. It seemed
to be a knob or a dial of some
kind, divided into segments
scored with vernier markings.
I gazed at Pending askance.</p>

<p>"Well, Pat? What now?"</p>

<p>"How much do you weigh,
Mr. Mallory?"</p>

<p>"One sixty-five," I answered.</p>

<p>"You're sure of that?"</p>

<p>"I'm not. But my bathroom
scales appeared to be. This
morning. Why?"</p>

<p>"Do you think Miss Joyce
could lift you?"</p>

<p>I said thoughtfully, "Well,
that's an idea. But I doubt it.
She won't even let me try to
support <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"I'm serious, Mr. Mallory.
Do you think she could lift
you with one hand?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly! Of course
not. Nor could you."</p>

<p>"There's where you're
wrong," said Pending firmly.
"She can&mdash;and will."</p>

<p>He reached forward suddenly
and twisted the metal
cap on the stick in my hands.
As he did so, I loosed a cry
of alarm and almost dropped
the baton. For instantaneously
I experienced a startling,
flighty giddiness, a sudden
loss of weight that made me
feel as if my soles were treading
on sponge rubber, my
shoulders sprouting wings.</p>

<p>"Hold on to it!" cried Pat.
Then to Joyce, "Lift him,
Miss Joyce."</p>

<p>Joyce faltered, "How? Like
th-this?" and touched a finger
to my midriff. Immediately
my feet left the floor. I started
flailing futilely to trample
six inches of ozone back to
the solid floorboards. To no
avail. With no effort whatever
Joyce raised me high
above her head until my
dazed dome was shedding
dandruff on the ceiling!</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Mallory," said
Pat, "do you believe me
now?"</p>

<p>"Get me down out of here!"
I howled. "You <i>know</i> I can't
stand high places!"</p>

<p>"You now weigh less than
ten pounds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the statistics.
I feel like a circus balloon.
How do I get down again?"</p>

<p>"Turn the knob on the
cane," advised Pat, "to your
normal weight. Careful, now!
<i>Not so fast!</i>"</p>

<p>His warning came too late.
I hit the deck with a resounding
thud, and the cane came
clattering after. Pat retrieved
it hurriedly, inspected it to
make sure it was not damaged.
I glared at him as I
picked myself off the floor.</p>

<p>"You might show some interest
in <i>me</i>," I grumbled. "I
doubt if that stick will need
a liniment rubdown tonight.
Okay, Pat. You're right and
I'm wrong, as you usually
are. That modern variation of
a witch's broomstick <i>does</i>
operate. Only&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"That dial at the top governs
weight," explained Pat.
"When you turn it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Skip that. I know how it
is operated. I want to know
what makes it work?"</p>

<p>"Well," explained Pat, "I'm
not certain I can make it
clear, but it's all tied in with
the elemental scientific problems
of mass, weight, gravity
and electric energy. What
<i>is</i> electricity, for example&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I used to know," I
frowned. "But I forget."</p>

<p>Joyce shook her head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Friends," she intoned,
"let us all bow our heads.
This is a moment of great
tragedy. The only man in the
world who ever knew what
electricity is&mdash;and he has forgotten!"</p>

<p>"That's the whole point,"
agreed Pending. "No one
knows what electricity really
is. All we know is how to use
it. Einstein has demonstrated
that the force of gravity and
electrical energy are kindred;
perhaps different aspects of
a common phenomenon. That
was my starting point."</p>

<p>"So this rod, which enables
you to defy the law of gravity,
is electrical?"</p>

<p>"Electricaceous," corrected
Pat. "You see, I have transmogrified
the polarifity of
certain ingredular cellulations.
A series of disentrigulated
helicosities, activated by
hypermagnetation, set up a
disruptular wave motion
which results in&mdash;counter-gravity!"</p>

<p>And there you are! Ninety-nine
percent of the time Pat
Pending talks like a normal
human being. But ask him to
explain the mechanism of one
of his inventions and linguistic
hell breaks loose. He
begins jabbering like a schizophrenic
parrot reading a Sanskrit
dictionary backward! I
sighed and surrendered all
hope of ever actually learning
<i>how</i> his great new discovery
worked. I turned my thoughts
to more important matters.</p>

<p>"Okay, Pat. We'll dismiss
the details as trivial and get
down to brass tacks. What is
your invention used for?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said the redhead.</p>

<p>"It's not enough that an idea
is practicable," I pointed out.
"It must also be practical to
be of any value in this frenzied
modern era. What good
is your invention?"</p>

<p>"What good," demanded
Joyce, "is a newborn baby?"</p>

<p>"Don't change the subject,"
I suggested. "Or come to
think of it, maybe you should.
At the diaper level, life is
just one damp thing after
another. But how to turn
Pat's brainchild into cold,
hard cash&mdash;that's the question
before the board now.</p>

<p>"Individual flight <i>a la</i> Superman?
No dice. I can testify
from personal experience
that once you get up there
you're completely out of control.
And I can't see any sense
in humans trying to fly with
jet flames scorching their
base of operations.</p>

<p>"Elevators? Derricks?
Building cranes? Possible.
But lifting a couple hundred
pounds is one thing. Lifting
a few tons is a horse of a different
color.</p>

<p>"No, Pat," I continued, "I
don't see just how&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sandy Thomas squeaked
suddenly and grasped my
arm.</p>

<p>"That's it, Mr. Mallory!"
she cried. "That's it!"</p>

<p>"Huh? What's what?"</p>

<p>"You wanted to know how
Pat could make money from
his invention. You've just answered
your own question."</p>

<p>"I have?"</p>

<p>"Horses! Horse racing, to
be exact. You've heard of
handicaps, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"I'm overwhelmed with
them," I nodded wearily. "A
secretary who repulses my
honorable advances, a receptionist
who squeals in my
ear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen, Mr. Mallory,
what's the last thing horses do
before they go to the post?"</p>

<p>"Check the tote board," I
said promptly, "to find out if
I've got any money on them.
Horses hate me. They've
formed an equine conspiracy
to prove to me the ancient
adage that a fool and his money
are soon parted."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" chimed in
Joyce thoughtfully. "I know
what Sandy means. They
weigh in. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"Exactly! The more weight
a horse is bearing, the slower
it runs. That's the purpose of
handicapping. But if a horse
that was supposed to be carrying
more than a hundred
pounds was actually only carrying
<i>ten</i>&mdash;Well, you see?"</p>

<p>Sandy paused, breathless. I
stared at her with a gathering
respect.</p>

<p>"Never underestimate the
power of a woman," I said,
"when it comes to devising
new and ingenious methods of
perpetrating petty larceny.
There's only one small fly in
the ointment, so far as I can
see. How do we convince some
racehorse owner he should become
a party to this gentle
felony?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't have to,"
smiled Sandy cheerfully. "I'm
already convinced."</p>

<p>"You? You own a horse?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Haven't you ever
heard of Tapwater?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure! That drip's running
all the time!"</p>

<p>Joyce tossed me a reproving
glance.</p>

<p>"This is a matter of gravity,
Donald," she stated, "and you
keep treating it with levity.
Sandy, do you <i>really</i> own
Tapwater? He's the colt who
won the Monmouth Futurity,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"That's right. And four
other starts this season. That's
been our big trouble. He
shows such promise that the
judges have placed him under
a terrific weight handicap. To
run in next week's Gold
Stakes, for instance, he would
have to carry 124 pounds. I
was hesitant to enter him because
of that. But with Pat's
new invention&mdash;" She turned
to Pat, eyes glowing&mdash;"he
could enter and win!"</p>

<p>Pat said uncertainly, "I
don't know. I don't like gambling.
And it doesn't seem
quite ethical, somehow&mdash;"</p>

<p>I asked Sandy, "Suppose he
ran carrying 124. What would
be the probable odds?"</p>

<p>"High," she replied, "<i>Very</i>
high. Perhaps as high as forty
to one."</p>

<p>"In that case," I decided,
"it's not only ethical, it's a
moral obligation. If you're opposed
to gambling, Pat, what
better way can you think of to
put the parimutuels out of
business?"</p>

<p>"And besides," Sandy pointed
out, "this would be a wonderful
opportunity to display
your new discovery before an
audience of thousands. Well,
Pat? What do you say?"</p>

<p>Pat hesitated, caught a
glimpse of Sandy's pleading
eyes, and was lost.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "We'll
do it. Mr. Mallory, enter Tapwater
in the Gold Stakes.
We'll put on the most spectaceous
exhibition in the history
of gambilizing!"</p>

<hr />

<p>Thus it was that approximately
one week later our piratical
little crew was assembled
once again, this time in
the paddock at Laurel. In
case you're an inland aborigine,
let me explain that Laurel
race track (from the township
of the same name) is
where horse fanciers from the
District of Columbia go to
abandon their Capitol and
capital on weekends.</p>

<p>We were briefing our jockey&mdash;a
scrawny youth with a
pair of oversized ears&mdash;on the
use of Pat's lightening rod.
Being short on gray matter as
well as on stature, he wasn't
getting it at all.</p>

<p>"You mean," he said for the
third or thirty-third time,
"you don't want I should <i>hit</i>
the nag with this bat?"</p>

<p>"Heavens, no!" gasped Pat,
blanching. "It's much too delicate
for that."</p>

<p>"Don't fool yourself, mister.
Horses can stand a lot of
leather."</p>

<p>"Not the horse, stupid," I
said. "The bat. This is the
only riding crop of its kind in
the world. We don't want it
damaged. All you have to do
is <i>carry</i> it. We'll do the rest."</p>

<p>"How about setting the
dial, Don?" asked Joyce.</p>

<p>"Pat will do that just before
the horses move onto the
track. Now let's get going.
It's weigh-in time."</p>

<p>We moved to the scales
with our rider. He stepped
aboard the platform, complete
with silks and saddle, and the
spinner leaped to a staggering
102, whereupon the officials
started gravely handing him
little leather sacks.</p>

<p>"What's this?" I whispered
to Sandy. "Prizes for malnutrition?
He must have won all
the blackjacks east of the Mississippi."</p>

<p>"The handicap," she whispered
back. "Lead weights at
one pound each."</p>

<p>"If he starts to lose," I ruminated,
"they'd make wonderful
ammunition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One hundred and twenty-four,"
announced the chief
weigher-inner. "Next entry!"</p>

<p>We returned to Tapwater.
The jockey fastened the
weights to his gear, saddled
up and mounted. From the
track came the traditional bugle
call. Sandy nodded to Pat.</p>

<p>"All right, Pat. Now!"</p>

<p>Pending twisted the knob
on his lightening rod and
handed the stick to the jockey.
The little horseman
gasped, rose three inches in
his stirrups, and almost let
go of the baton.</p>

<p>"H-hey!" he exclaimed. "I
feel funny. I feel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that," I told
him. "Just you hold on to that
rod until the race is over.
And when you come back, give
it to Pat immediately. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I feel so&mdash;so
lightheaded&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's because you're
featherbrained," I advised
him. "Now, get going. Giddyap,
Dobbin!"</p>

<p>I patted Tapwater's flank,
and so help me Newton, I
think that one gentle tap
pushed the colt half way to
the starting gate! He pattered
across the turf with a curious
bouncing gait as if he were
running on tiptoe. We hastened
to our seats in the
grandstand.</p>

<p>"Did you get all the bets
down?" asked Joyce.</p>

<p>I nodded and displayed a
deck of ducats. "It may not
have occurred to you, my
sweet," I announced gleefully,
"but these pasteboards are
transferrable on demand to
rice and old shoes, the sweet
strains of <i>Oh, Promise Me!</i>
and the scent of orange blossoms.
You insisted I should
have a nest egg before you
would murmur, 'I do'? Well,
after this race these tickets
will be worth&mdash;" I cast a
swift last glance at the tote
board's closing odds, quoting
Tapwater at 35 to 1&mdash;"approximately
seventy thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>"Donald!" gasped Joyce.
"You didn't bet all your savings?"</p>

<p>"Every cent," I told her
cheerfully. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"But if something should
go wrong! If Tapwater should
lose!"</p>

<p>"He won't. See what I
mean?"</p>

<p>For even as we were talking,
the bell jangled, the crowd
roared, and the horses were
off. Eight entries surged
from the starting gate. And
already one full length out in
front pranced the weight-free,
lightfoot Tapwater!</p>

<p>At the quarter post our colt
had stretched his lead to
three lengths, and I shouted
in Pending's ear, "How much
does that jockey weigh, anyway?"</p>

<p>"About six pounds," said
Pat. "I turned the knob to
cancel one eighteen."</p>

<p>At the half, all the other
horses could glimpse of Tapwater
was heels. At the three-quarter
post he was so far
ahead that the jockey must
have been lonely. As he
rounded into the stretch I
caught a binocular view of his
face, and he looked dazed and
a little frightened. He wasn't
actually <i>riding</i> Tapwater. The
colt was simply skimming
home, and he was holding on
for dear life to make sure he
didn't blow off the horse's
back. The result was a foregone
conclusion, of course.
Tapwater crossed the finish
line nine lengths ahead, setting
a new track record.</p>

<p>The crowd went wild. Over
the hubbub I clutched Pat's
arm and bawled, "I'll go collect
our winnings. Hurry
down to the track and swap
that lightening rod for the
real bat we brought along.
He'll have to weigh out
again, you know. Scoot!"</p>

<p>The others vanished paddockward
as I went for the
big payoff. It was dreary at
the totalizer windows. I was
one of a scant handful who
had bet on Tapwater, so it
took no time at all to scoop
into the valise I had brought
along the seventy thousand
bucks in crisp, green lettuce
which an awed teller passed
across the counter. Then I
hurried back to join the others
in the winner's circle,
where bedlam was not only
reigning but pouring. Flashbulbs
were popping all over
the place, cameramen were
screaming for just one more
of the jockey, the owner, the
fabulous Tapwater. The officials
were vainly striving to
quiet the tumult so they
could award the prize. I
found Pending worming his
way out of the heart of the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Did you get it?" I demanded.</p>

<p>He nodded, thrust the
knobbed baton into my hand.</p>

<p>"You substituted the normal
one?"</p>

<p>Again he nodded. Hastily I
thrust the lightening rod out
of sight into my valise, and
we elbowed forward to share
the triumphant moment. It
was a great experience. I felt
giddy with joy; I was walking
on little pink clouds of
happiness. Security was mine
at last. And Joyce, as well.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen!"
cried the chief official. "Your
attention, please! Today we
have witnessed a truly spectacular
feat: the setting of a
new track record by a champion
racing under a tremendous
handicap. I give you a
magnificent racehorse&mdash;<i>Tapwater</i>!"</p>

<p>"That's right, folks!" I
bawled, carried away by the
excitement. "Give this little
horse a great big hand!"</p>

<p>Setting the example, I laid
down the bag, started clapping
vigorously. From a distance
I heard Pat Pending's
agonized scream.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mallory&mdash;the suitcase!
Grab it!"</p>

<p>I glanced down, belatedly
aware of the danger of theft.
But too late. The bag had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Hey!" I yelled. "Who
swiped my bag? Police!"</p>

<p>"Up there, Mr. Mallory!"
bawled Pat. "Jump!"</p>

<p>I glanced skyward. Three
feet above my head and rising
swiftly was the valise in
which I had cached not only
our winnings but Pat's gravity-defying
rod! I leaped&mdash;but
in vain. I was <i>still</i> making
feeble, futile efforts to
make like the moon-hurdling
nursery rhyme cow when
quite a while later two strong
young men in white jackets
came and jabbed me with a
sedative ...</p>

<hr />

<p>Later, when time and
barbiturates had dulled the
biting edge of my despair, we
assembled once again in my
office and I made my apologies
to my friends.</p>

<p>"It was all my fault," I
acknowledged. "I should have
realized Pat hadn't readjusted
the rod when I placed it
in my bag. It felt lighter. But
I was so excited&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was <i>my</i> fault," mourned
Pat, "for not changing it immediately.
But I was afraid
someone might see me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if we hired an
airplane&mdash;?" I suggested.</p>

<p>Pat shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Mallory. The rod
was set to cancel 118 pounds.
The bag weighed less than
twenty. It will go miles beyond
the reach of any airplane
before it settles into an
orbit around earth."</p>

<p>"Well, there goes my
dreamed-of fortune," I said
sadly. "Accompanied by the
fading strains of an unplayed
wedding march. I'm sorry,
Joyce."</p>

<p>"Isn't there one thing you
folks are overlooking?" asked
Sandy Thomas. "My goodness,
you'd think we had lost
our last cent just because that
little old bag flew away!"</p>

<p>"For your information," I
told her, "that is precisely
what happened to me. My entire
bank account vanished
into the wild blue yonder.
And some of Pat's money,
too."</p>

<p>"But have you forgotten,"
she insisted, "that we <i>won</i>
the race? Of course the track
officials were a wee bit suspicious
when your suitcase
took off. But they couldn't
prove anything. So they paid
me the Gold Stakes prize. If
we split it four ways, we all
make a nice little profit.</p>

<p>"Or," she added, "if you
and Joyce want to make yours
a double share, we could split
it three ways.</p>

<p>"Or," she continued hopefully,
"if Pat wants to, we
could make <i>two</i> double shares,
and split it fifty-fifty?"</p>

<p>From the look in Pat's eyes
I knew he was stunned by
this possibility. And from the
look in hers, I felt she was
going to make every effort to
take advantage of his bewilderment.</p>

<p>So, as I said before, what
this country needs is a good
cigar-shaped spaceship.
There's a fortune waiting
somewhere out in space for
the man who can go out there
and claim it. Seventy thousand
bucks in cold, hard cash.</p>

<p>Indubitatiously!</p>
